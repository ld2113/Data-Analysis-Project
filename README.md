# Data-Analysis-Project

## ToDo
- Fix generator (without SMOTE)
- Do random sampling in generator instead of SMOTE (compare methods)
- Include automatic NN metric logging
- Compare performance of different autoencoder outputs
- How to do partial embedding for test and validation data
- Create network with two seperate inputs which are later joined
- Is it actually okay to train the autoencoder without holdout?
- use 4/7/10D embedding
- Pass val. data directly to network (rather then testing later)
- Write multiprocessing generator

- Use crossvalidation to validate NN sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedKfold
- Find way to replace embedding

- Website
-- viz: different network structures and their performance - interactive
-- viz: subsample embedding
