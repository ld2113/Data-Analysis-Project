## Abstract
Current biochemical high-throughput methods for detecting novel protein-protein interactions are prone to significant Type I and Type II errors. Computational tools with the ability to produce high-quality predictions have hence been investigated for several years.
In this work, we present a feed-forward artificial neural network for the prediction of novel protein-protein interactions. We combine available interaction data, Gene Ontology annotations and protein domain data as inputs to our model. The nature of our model provides fully automated data integration without requiring manual weighting of the different input data sources.
We were able to reconstruct artificially removed edges from the human interactome with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.19 and F1 score of 0.17. Considering the complexity of the problem,  this result highlights the potential of combining supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches to solve biological problems using a diverse range of input data types.
